            "The Mexican-American labor leader and civil rights activist Cesar Chavez dedicated his lifeâ€™s work to what
            he called la causa (the cause): the struggle of farm workers in the United States to improve their working
            and living conditions through organizing and negotiating contracts with their employers.
            <br><br>
            Committed to the tactics of nonviolent resistance practiced by Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.,
            Chavez founded the National Farm Workers Association (later the United Farm Workers of America) and won
            important victories to raise pay and improve working conditions for farm workers in the late 1960s and
            1970s."
